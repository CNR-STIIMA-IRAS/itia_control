# ITIA CONTROL UTILITIES by CNR-ITIA (www.itia.cnr.it)

The repository contains the implementation of different algorithms developed by the Institute of Industrial Technologies and Automation, of the National Research Council of Italy (CNR-ITIA).


# Overview

The control of SEA needs advanced model-based control methodologies. The package is intended to be used with itia_dynamics, despite the stand-alone use is possible.
 

# Installation and supported ROS versions

Download and compile the package (there are no particular dependencies, only the ROS standard installation is required).

The package has been tested with ROS 'Indigo', 'Jade' and 'Kinetic'.


# Usage

See each control algorithm usage.



# MATLAB  

The package provides also scripts to decode the binary files in MATLAB.
More details are reported in **scripts** ([README](scripts/README.md)).
